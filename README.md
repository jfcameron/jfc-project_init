[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jfcameron/jfc-project_init.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jfcameron/jfc-project_init)

## jfc-project_init

sets up a new cpp project in the style of the c++ projects found on my github account.

Technologies used by the generated project: git, cmake, doxygen, travis-ci (free build service for open-source projects).

pngs, Readme.md, License.md, etc. content is all contained within the source code of the project, so no configuration files in ~/.config/..., C:\...\AppData\..., are required. To change these things, make a source code change and recompile.

The tool builds for Linux, Mac, Windows. 

see .travis.yml for build instructions
